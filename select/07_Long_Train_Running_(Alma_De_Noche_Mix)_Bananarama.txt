Down around the corner
Half a mile from here
See them long trains run
And you watch them disappear

Without love
Where would you be now?
Without love

You know I saw Miss Lucy
Down along the tracks
She lost her home and her family
And she won't be coming back

Without love
Where would you be right now?
Without love

Well the Illinois Central
And the Southern Central freight
Gotta keep on pushing mama
You know they're running late

Without love
Where would you be now?
Without love

Well the pistons keep on turning
And the wheels go 'round and 'round
And the steel rails are cold and hard
For the miles that they go down

Without love
Where would you be now?
Without love
Where would you be now?

Baby, baby, baby, baby
Won't you move it down?
I gotta keep on moving
Gotta keep on moving

Without love
Where would you be now?
Without love

Baby, baby, baby, baby
Won't you move it down
I gotta keep on moving
Gotta keep on moving

Without love
Where would you be now?
Without love

Baby, baby, baby, baby
Won't you move it down?
I gotta keep on moving
Gotta keep on moving

Without love
Where would you be now?
